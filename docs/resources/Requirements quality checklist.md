Requirements Document Quality Checklist

Checks of the Document Structure
1.	Is the template for the document up to date?
a.	Do the boilerplate sections reflect our current procedures and best practices?
b.	Is there a section that defines how imperatives and 
other standardized language shall be used and interpreted?
c.	Are there any sections that need to be revised?

2.	Does the document follow our agreed hierarchical structure?

3.	Are requirements identifiers linked to the document structure?
a.	Does the structure help the users find requirements easily?
Checks of Each Written Requirement
4.	Is the requirement tagged with a Project Unique Identifier?

5.	Has the proper imperative been used for the requirement?
a.	Has the imperative (shall or must) been used once and only once?
b.	Has the imperative been used according to our standardization rules?
c.	Are all other standardized words used according to our standardization rules?

6.	Can an objective test be written for the requirement?
a.	Are both a test method and a test case evident in the wording of the requirement?
b.	Are all necessary reaction windows or other tolerances stated in the requirement?

7.	If the requirement is functional, is it implementation-neutral?
a.	Does the requirement clearly state what the system must do 
and not how the system must do it?
b.	Is the requirement stated strictly in terms of its external interfaces,
or behaviors that can be readily observed?

8.	Has the rationale for the requirement been clearly stated?
a.	Are there any associated requirements that might affect the interpretation of this requirement and should therefore be referenced in the rationale statement?
b.	If no rationale statement has been included, is the rationale obvious in the requirement statement or from associated directives or references?

9.	Does the requirement include a directive?
a.	If so, does the reference clarify the requirement, and is it easy to locate?
b.	If not, could the requirement be simplified or clarified through use of a directive?
 
10.	Is the requirement stated clearly and concisely?
a.	Is it formatted according to our agreed best practices?

11.	Are the requirement's preconditions and triggers clearly defined within the requirement?

12.	Have exception scenarios been explored for this requirement?
a.	Have the corresponding exception conditions been properly and 
clearly stated within the requirement or referenced via directive?

13.	Is the requirement stated in precise, measurable terms?
a.	Is it free of weak words (like the following)?
 
efficient
powerful
fast
easy
effective
reliable
compatible
normal
user-friendly
before
after
quickly
timely
strengthen
enhance
 

14.	Has the requirement been stated in active voice?
a.	Has passive voice (shall be) been avoided?
b.	If the requirement is non-functional, has it been stated using the imperative must?

15.	Does the requirement state what the system shall do, rather than what it shall not do?
a.	If "shall not" has been used, is the use of the negative justified (for safety, etc.),
and have double negatives been avoided?

16.	Where "compatibility" is required, has the nature of that compatibility been fully defined?

17.	Does the requirement contain any slashes (/) or other symbols that might be ambiguous?
a.	Could the requirement be split or otherwise restated to remove any ambiguity?

18.	Is the requirement specific, rather than vague?
a.	Does it give the implementation team a clear, precise target to shoot for?
Final Quality Checks
19.	Has each requirement been evaluated and vetted by all stakeholders who are impacted by it?
a.	Which design and implementation groups are affected?
b.	Which test and integration groups are affected?
c.	Are any third-party equipment organizations affected?
d.	Which maintenance and support organizations are affected?
e.	Do safety specialists, human factors specialists or users need to evaluate it?

20.	Are all the impacted stakeholders on the circulation list for 
final review of the requirements document?
a.	Have we provided each of them a list of the requirements they need to review?
