Hi <username> What do you want to do?

    new or existing project?

        which test-language?
        
            java / python

    Please specify a new feature/scenario in <projectname>

    Matches a feature/scenario that already exists?
    
        Display and prompt to edit exiting feat/scen

    Fnd the nearest feature template and generate a ".feature"

    Any weak words exist?

        Ask probing specific  questions to seek objective replacements for a weak word  
        (loop till no weak words remain)
        
	Add another feature to <current project> (Y/N)?...
